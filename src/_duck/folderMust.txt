A duck folder MUST:

contain the entire logic for handling only ONE concept in your app, ex: product, cart, session, etc.
have an index.js file that exports according to the original duck rules.
keep code with similar purpose in the same file, such as reducers, selectors, and actions
contain the tests related to the duck.


Function vs Feature
There are two established approaches of structuring applications: function-first and feature-first.


Function-first means that your top-level directories are named after the purpose of the files inside. So you have: containers, components, actions, reducers, etc.

Feature-first means that the top-level directories are named after the main features of the app: product, cart, session.
